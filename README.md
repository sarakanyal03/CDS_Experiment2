AIM: <br>
To study and implement C++ program strucutres (Data Type). <br>

THEORY: <br>
Data types in C++ programming language is defined as the type of data that can be manipulated and stored within a program. they play vital role in efficient memory management, especially performing various operations with data. As we know C++ supports a massive variety of data types, which can be broadly categorized into three types as follows. <br>
i) Primitive data types: <br>
'int', 'short', 'long','long long', 'unsigned int','char', 'unsigned char', 'signed char', 'float', 'double', 'long double', 'bool' <br>
ii) Defined data type <br>
iii) User defined data types <br>
Moreon we use 'sizeof' command for determination of size of data types. It shows the number of bytes occupied by any variable in a computer memory.<br>
Storage class here determinesthe characteristics of a variable. Mainly it has five types, as follows: <br>
i) 'auto' <br>
ii) 'register' <br>
iii) 'static' <br>
iv) 'extern' <br>
v) 'mutable' <br>

CONCLUSION: <br>
We learnt deeply about data types in c++ programming language. By implementing data types we not only cherish our theoritical knowledge but also develop better problem solving skills.
