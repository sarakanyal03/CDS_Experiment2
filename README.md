AIM: <br>
To study and implement C++ program strucutres (Data Type). <br>

THEORY: <br>
Data types in C++ programming language is defined as the type of data that can be manipulated and stored within a program. Data types are crucial for efficient memory management, especially for performing various operations with data. As we know C++ supports a massive variety of data types, which can be broadly categorized into primitive data types, derived data types, and user-defined data types.
